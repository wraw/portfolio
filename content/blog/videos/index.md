##### H4CKED OFF

The *H4CKED OFF* is a project that assembles cyber attacks data collected by Norse Corporation and presenting it onto 4 clocks that represents four different countries. Clocks are reacting randomly, based on real-time attacks. The clock is going normal if the attacks are not happening, but if attack occur clock is ticking anti-clockwise. We have chosen to disrupt a physical object with live data. The idea was to display hacker attacks onto five clocks that represent five countries being most attacked in real time. In our intentions, our project gains the live data from the Norse API or feed provided by them. By this, this artwork addresses the notion of *realtime*.
