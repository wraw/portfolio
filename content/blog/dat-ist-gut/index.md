*DAT ist gut* was the second year exhibition prepared with all of the students from my degree. The Exhibition was held in the main building of the university for 3 days. For the propose of this event, I created visual identity including posters and a t-shirt.

DAT stands for **D**igital **A**rt (and) **T**echnology which is the name of my bachelor's degree. We came up with this witty bilingual name after the second yearâ€™s trip to Germany. All of the graphical design prepared for this event was created by me.
